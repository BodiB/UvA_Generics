               - Preparing zoom meeting
               - Zoom meeting at 4pm (ended ca. 4.55pm)
                 + Research project on the Semantics of generic statements (Cows produces milk, Dutch people are tall)
                 + Generic statements can be used to interact with the world, but complicated to understand how people form these statements.
                 + Difficult to determine (not one correct answer) on when people tend to classify a generic statement as true.
                 On the Project itself, what is expected:
                 + Data on how the user interacts with the interface.
                 + First version will be a 'cards' clicking 'game'. (Frogs example)
                 + Only people can fill in the research (avoid bots - Captcha?)
                 + Collect data anonymously - but need data on research group - age, gender,...
                 + Securely stored?
                 TO DO LIST:
                 + Set-Up GitHub Repo, invite PLMir ==DONE==
                 Agreements:
                 + Weekly Zoom meeting - Wednesday at 4pm
                 + Part of the research - *ToDo - implement own project within the overarching research*
                     **limited size version of the predicted target - 'pilot' experiment
               - Received mail after meeting:
                 + Platform used to share experiment: prolific.co
                 + Python package: PsychoPy (no experience with the package)
                 + Attached Paper
                 + Link to preview of experiment used in the paper: https://uvacommscience.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/preview/SV_cNfZbA2ecK2UX1r?Q_SurveyVersionID=current&Q_CHL=preview
                 + Request to keep a "log file" within the GitHub repo. ==DONE==
                   => Was already planning on this, also because this was mentiond during the first 'lecture'.
                      The log file could also help to save time if things in a later stadium have to be redone.
               - ACHIEVEMENTS TODAY (after Zoom meeting):
                 + Set-Up GitHub Repo

                     % Not (directly) a feature of Qualtrics,
                       but just found out Qualtrics has some kind of JavaScript
                       support which might be usefull and would make the app redundant.
                       * Apparently can not be found in the free version.
                   !! Able to analyse the data.
                     + Should be 'easy' after data is stored correctly in the database
                     ? What data do you need to be able to do the analysis?
                     ?
                   !!
               - Meeting at 4pm

                      instead of creating a new program

# TODO (Convert to english)
Wagner algorithm
Om en om openen, user vs computer.
Learning rate is afhankelijk van welke tegel je openklikt.
Onderbreken van de flow zodat ze op blijven letten.
Niet 5*5 want dan te bewust, voorkomen.
Groter grid -> zodat mensen er niet bewust van zijn hoe groot de grid is.
