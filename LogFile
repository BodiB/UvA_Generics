               - Zoom meeting at 4pm (ended ca. 4.55pm)
                 + Research project on the Semantics of generic statements (Cows produces milk, Dutch people are tall)
                 + Generic statements can be used to interact with the world, but complicated to understand how people form these statements.
                 + Difficult to determine (not one correct answer) on when people tend to classify a generic statement as true.
                 On the Project itself, what is expected:
                 + Data on how the user interacts with the interface.
                 + First version will be a 'cards' clicking 'game'. (Frogs example)
                 + Only people can fill in the research (avoid bots - Captcha?)
                 + Collect data anonymously - but need data on research group - age, gender,...
                 + Securely stored?
                 TO DO LIST:
                 + Set-Up GitHub Repo, invite PLMir ==DONE==
                 Agreements:
                 + Weekly Zoom meeting - Wednesday at 4pm
                 + Part of the research - *ToDo - implement own project within the overarching research*
                     **limited size version of the predicted target - 'pilot' experiment
               - Received mail after meeting:
                 + Platform used to share experiment: prolific.co
                 + Python package: PsychoPy (no experience with the package)
                 + Attached Paper
                 + Link to preview of experiment used in the paper: https://uvacommscience.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/preview/SV_cNfZbA2ecK2UX1r?Q_SurveyVersionID=current&Q_CHL=preview
                 + Request to keep a "log file" within the GitHub repo. ==DONE==
                   => Was already planning on this, also because this was mentiond during the first 'lecture'.
                      The log file could also help to save time if things in a later stadium have to be redone.
